**Context.** Every turn sends the conversation so far back to the model. A long planning conversation can run to dozens of messages, and replaying all of them costs tokens and time. Each conversation also gets an episode, a one-sentence summary stored as a Memory.

**Question.** How much history a turn carries.

**Decision.** Each turn replays at most the last twenty messages. When the cap bites, the conversation's episode sentence is prepended once so the model still knows how it started.

**Why.** Long conversations must stay fast and coherent without replaying everything.

**What else was considered.** A larger cap, or no cap. Both lost on cost and speed.

**What it touches.** vana-chat replayHistory.

## mp-033 · A mid-conversation episode is written in the background when the cap first bites

**Context.** The prepend above needs an episode to exist. Episodes were only written by the read-back of a finished conversation. So a conversation still open at twenty messages had no episode and the front of it was simply dropped. The prepend had never fired.

**Question.** When to write an episode for a conversation that is still going.

**Decision.** When a conversation crosses twenty messages with no episode, the episode half of the extractor runs after the reply is sent and the next turn picks it up. One Haiku call per conversation.

**Why.** The prepend had never fired because episodes were only written for finished conversations.

**What else was considered.** Write the episode synchronously and delay the reply. It lost because the athlete would wait on a call they cannot see.

**What it touches.** chat.ts replayHistory, extract.ts writeOpenEpisode.

## mp-034 · The open episode reads the opening half of the transcript

**Context.** The mid-conversation episode has to summarise what the model is about to lose, which is the start of the conversation. Feeding the whole transcript produced a list of recent topics with the opening gone, and the eval failed. There is one call to spend per conversation.

**Question.** Which part of the transcript the episode reads.

**Decision.** The episode is written from the first half of the transcript, with a prompt that asks for names and numbers. Past about forty messages the front is lost again, which the one-call budget accepts.

**Why.** The whole transcript produced a list of recent topics with the opening gone, and the eval failed.

**What else was considered.** Read only the dropped rows, which lost as too thin. Read the whole transcript, which lost the opening.

**What it touches.** extract.ts.

## mp-035 · The open episode never stamps read-back and never overwrites

**Context.** The read-back of a finished conversation stamps it as read so it is never mined twice. The mid-conversation episode is only half of that job. The margin notes are still owed once the conversation ends. Two writers can also reach the same conversation.

**Question.** How the open episode fits beside the full read-back.

**Decision.** The open episode does not mark the conversation as read back, because margin notes are still owed later. If the read-back or a concurrent turn already wrote an episode, that one stands.

**Why.** One keyed row, one recall mechanism, no lost notes.

**What else was considered.** none recorded

**What it touches.** extract.ts.

## mp-036 · Episode reads take the newest row and there is no unique index yet

**Context.** Two writers can race and each insert an episode row for the same conversation. The read expected exactly one row, errored on two, and the episode was lost for good. A database rule allowing one episode per conversation would close the race. That is a schema change on a table already on dev.

**Question.** Whether to change the schema now or make the read tolerant.

**Decision.** Reads take the newest episode row when there is more than one. A partial unique index would close the race but was left out as a schema change.

**Why.** A single-row read used to error on two rows and lose the episode for good.

**What else was considered.** Add the partial unique index now. It lost as a schema change outside the ticket.

**What it touches.** memory.ts.

## mp-038 · The context says what they said last, not their schedule

**Context.** The context block has a MEMORIES section. Episodes were listed there beside the margin notes. An episode is a summary of a conversation, so the opener read it back as "last time we planned Tuesday's ride and Thursday's swim". That is a schedule, not a memory of the person.

**Question.** How the context presents past conversations.

**Decision.** The context gains a LAST TALKS line holding what the athlete said in recent conversations. The MEMORIES block holds only non-episode notes.

**Why.** Episodes in the memories block read as a schedule read-out instead of a memory of the person.

**What else was considered.** none recorded

**What it touches.** context.ts.

## mp-210 · What context each Vana entry point gets

- image: none
- caption:
- screen: Vana chat, events page, coach formula feedback
- source: Lee on the page 2026-09-13, amending mp-002

**Context.** Vana is reached from several places: the sheet over any screen, the Plan tab, the full-screen chat, a formula's coach feedback, and the events page. Today the sheet and Plan tab hand her the Doll plus a one-line Situation naming the screen. The formula and events entry points were built earlier and hand her something different, or less. The question is what each entry point owes her.

**Question.** Vana has different entry points. Coach formulas will have different conversations to meal planning to general chat. Each entry point needs different context. The formulas conversation needs formula context, and the events page needs the upcoming events. We have not figured this out enough and need to think it through. All contexts should have the Voodoo Doll of the given user.

**Why.** Without a rule per entry point, each screen invents its own context and Vana knows different things depending on where she was opened.

**What it touches.** Situation resolver, context builder, coach formula feedback, events page, sheet.

## mp-211 · Which entry points continue a conversation and which start a new one

- source: Lee on the page 2026-09-13, amending mp-003

**Context.** Vana can be reached from the sheet over any screen, the Plan tab's note, the New meal plan button, the full-screen chat, and the history list. Today the sheet continues one conversation per day, and New meal plan opens a fresh planning conversation. The rules for the other entry points were never written down together.

**Question.** We need to figure out conversation histories. When we press New meal plan, or ask a question cold by pressing a button somewhere, the expectation is that this is a new conversation and not an existing one. We should still be able to list and see prior questions we have asked.

**Why.** If two entry points disagree about whether they continue or start fresh, the athlete lands in a conversation they did not expect.

**What it touches.** Ambient conversation controller, chat route, history list, opener.

## mp-215 · Is sending the whole context every turn wasteful

- source: Lee on the page 2026-09-13, rejecting mp-019

**Context.** The model keeps nothing between calls. Every turn is a fresh request that carries the persona, the athlete context block, and the recent history, so the model reads the context again each time. That is how every chat model works, including the one behind this page. Provider prompt caching can make a repeated prefix much cheaper without changing what is sent. The alternative is to leave the context out and fetch pieces by tool when the model asks, which saves tokens but makes Vana forget things unless she remembers to ask.

**Question.** Do we send the entire context each time? Is this not wasteful? Does Claude not remember this context within a conversation?

**Why.** The decision on cost per turn depends on whether the repeated block can be cached and on how often a turn actually needs it.

**What it touches.** vana-chat context builder, model call options.

## mp-216 · How long the opener waits for the read-back

- source: Lee on the page 2026-09-13, rejecting mp-009

**Context.** When a conversation opens, the previous one is read back in the background to pull out new notes. The opener wants those notes. The shipped rule waited up to 3.5 seconds, then went ahead with the athlete's last words in place of the notes. Lee rejected the fixed wait as too deterministic and asked for a revisit.

**Question.** This is too deterministic. Why are we doing this? We need to revisit it.

**Why.** The opener is the first thing the athlete reads. A wrong wait either delays it or makes it forget last time.

**What it touches.** Opener path in vana-chat, read-back extraction.

## mp-217 · How Vana remembers, within and across conversations

- image: none
- caption:
- screen: none (algorithm/data)
- source: Lee on the page 2026-09-14, on mp-009, mp-026, mp-032 to mp-036, mp-038

**Context.** The model remembers nothing between turns. Every turn is a fresh request carrying the persona, the athlete context, and whatever history the app chooses to resend. Everything that looks like memory is plumbing the app built: a 20-message replay window, a one-sentence episode written mid-conversation and again at the end, a read-back of the previous conversation when the next one opens, a 3.5 second wait for that read-back, and a LAST TALKS line in the context. Seven decisions describe those pieces: mp-009 (rejected), mp-026 (rejected), and mp-032 to mp-036 and mp-038, now held. Lee reviewed them together and asked for a rethink and research before any of them is treated as settled.

**Question.** Do we need previous-conversation extraction like this? We need to remove plumbing like this if it exists. If there is a new conversation, we should have summarised the earlier one sometime before that. Research how other chatbots approach this: whether they summarise, when, how many messages they keep, and how they keep costs low. Is this the best we can do, or is there another way of handling all of this?

**Why.** These pieces decide what Vana knows on any given turn and what each turn costs. A wrong strategy either makes her forget or makes every turn expensive.

**What it touches.** vana-chat history replay, extract.ts, the episode row, the opener path, the context builder. Research: docs/research/conversation-memory-strategies.md (2026-09-14).

## mp-267 · What moving from freemium to a trial requires

- caption:
- screen: Paywall
- source: Lee on the page 2026-09-14, on mp-052

**Context.** The app sells AI credit bundles and a Pro subscription, with meal planning behind Pro and general chat costing a credit for free users. Lee is replacing that with a seven-day trial of the whole app followed by purchase. The store products, the RevenueCat offering, the gate flag and the entitlements table were all built for free and Pro. Lee added on 2026-09-14: the app-side entitlements table goes away under the trial model, and meal planning does not ship until the trial exists.

**Question.** We need to discuss what we need to do in order to move away from a freemium to a purchase model. What are the store products and introductory offers, how does RevenueCat run the trial, what can an expired trial still open, what happens to the credits system, and what happens to accounts that exist today?

**Why.** Every paywall decision on this page was written for free and Pro. Until this is answered the three Pro cards cannot be approved as written.

**What it touches.** Store products, RevenueCat offering, entitlements table, gate flag, credits system, Pro screen, mp-254 to mp-256.

**Context.** mp-286 gives coaches nothing special for now. Lee has a rule for coaches in mind that depends on a paywall document Xuan is providing.

**Question.** We have something to say about coaches, but that will rely on a paywall document that Xuan will provide. What do coaches pay, and what does the paywall say to them?

**Why.** Coaches bring athletes in; whether the gate stands between a coach and their athletes decides how the app is sold to teams.

**What it touches.** Coach registration, the app gate, the paywall, mp-286.

## mp-288 · The client says when a conversation is idle, as a flag on the chat call

- screen: none (algorithm/data)
- source: spec mealplanning 2026-09-15

**Context.** Vana does not know the person she is talking to, and what looked like memory was plumbing that ran when the next conversation opened. mp-277 rules that the client tells the server when a conversation goes idle and the server writes its episode then. The spec's Implementation Decisions say how that signal travels; this card is that paragraph.

**Question.** How the client tells the server a conversation is idle.

**Decision.** 
1. The idle signal is a flag on the existing chat call, the way the opener flag rides it (mp-253). No new function.
2. The client sends it when the sheet closes, the app goes to the background, or a new conversation starts. It is fire-and-forget: nothing waits on the reply.
3. The server is idempotent: a second signal for a conversation that already has its episode writes nothing.
4. Offline, the signal is dropped. That conversation is read back the next time it is opened; its margin notes were already written by the remember tool in the hot path. No scheduled sweep yet.

**Why.** The opener flag already proves the pattern, and one call path keeps auth, rate limits and logging in one place. Fire-and-forget keeps the sheet's close instant.

**What else was considered.** A separate idle endpoint (a second path to secure and log); a scheduled server sweep (deferred by mp-277 until a miss shows).

**What it touches.** vana-chat request body, the sheet controller, the chat route, app lifecycle observer, extract.ts.

## mp-289 · The store trial is verified by hand in sandbox, never in CI

- screen: none (algorithm/data)
- source: spec mealplanning 2026-09-15

**Context.** Vana does not know the person she is talking to, and meal planning cannot ship until the seven-day trial exists. The trial is run by the stores and gated by RevenueCat (mp-279), which no test in the repo can drive. The spec's Testing Decisions say how the trial is proven; this card is that paragraph.

**Question.** How the trial, the gate and the Allowance are verified end to end.

**Decision.** 
1. A fresh sandbox account on each store subscribes through the introductory offer. The entitlement is active on day one, the webhook lands the Allowance, the subscription is cancelled, the account meets the paywall, and Restore reopens it.
2. The run is by hand, written up with the release, and never in CI. The webhook's own logic (grant on renewal, stale event ignored, transfer moves the row) is tested at the server seam with fake events.

**Why.** Only the stores can run an introductory offer, and a sandbox clock cannot be driven from a test. The seam test covers what the app owns; the hand run covers what it does not.

**What else was considered.** Mocking RevenueCat end to end (proves nothing about the store); skipping the hand run (the first person to hit day eight would be a customer).

**What it touches.** revenuecat-webhook seam tests, the release checklist, the paywall.

## mp-290 · The cache and the compaction are tested by shape, not by price

**Context.** Vana does not know the person she is talking to, and every turn paid full price for a prompt four fifths identical to the last. mp-276 turns caching on and freezes the context block per conversation; mp-277 chunks the history at forty. Neither can be asserted by cost in a test. The spec's Testing Decisions say what is asserted instead; this card is that paragraph.

**Question.** How caching and compaction are tested.

**Decision.** 
1. The token-budget test (mp-218) also builds the block twice for one athlete with no writes between and asserts the two are byte-identical, and that a tool write or a day change produces a different block.
2. The compaction test feeds conversations of thirty-nine, forty and sixty-one messages and asserts the replayed shape: all verbatim; one summary plus twenty; one rolled summary plus twenty. It asserts the summary is keyed to the index it covers and that the turn returns before the summary call does.
3. The eval seam records cache-read tokens per case and fails a case whose second turn reads zero.

**Why.** A stable prefix is a property of bytes, and a cache hit is a number the provider reports; both are testable without a price. The eval catches a silent miss (a prefix under the model's minimum, or a change before the breakpoint) the day it happens.

**What else was considered.** Asserting dollar cost per turn (depends on prices that change); trusting the gateway's automatic mode without a read count (a silent miss stays silent).

**What it touches.** tests/vana context_block and a new replay test, vana-eval, vana_calls log.
