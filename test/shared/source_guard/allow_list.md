# Report source guard: allow-list

Read by `report_source_guard_test.dart` (rules in `source_guard.dart`). One
entry per line, counted: a file with three identical unreported catch lines
needs three entries. Line format:

    <kind> <path> :: <signature>              (baseline)
    <kind> <path> :: <signature> :: <reason>  (reasoned)

`<kind>` is `unreportedCatch`, `printInCatch` or `sentryImport`; `<signature>`
is the trimmed source line holding the `catch` / bare `on` keyword (or the
import). Lines starting with `>` are notes.

> `baseline` holds every violation on the branch the day the guard landed
> (2026-10-06). Entries are only ever deleted, by the migration ticket that
> fixes the site; the test fails on a stale entry, so this section can only
> shrink. Nothing is added here.
>
> `reasoned` holds sites that stay silent on purpose, each with a one-line
> reason. Adding one is a review decision, not a shortcut.

## reasoned

unreportedCatch lib/features/integrations/data/vdot_api_client.dart :: } catch (_) {  :: the body is read as JSON only to pick out an error message; a non-JSON body (HTML error page) is an expected input and the raw text is the fallback output
unreportedCatch lib/shared/services/sentry/sentry_provider_observer.dart :: } on ArgumentError {  :: Expando refuses primitive keys; the catch is the type test, the primitive goes to its own set
unreportedCatch lib/shared/services/sentry/sentry_provider_observer.dart :: } on ArgumentError {  :: same as above, the mark side of the pair
